# Heart-Attack-Prediction-Model
This is a Machine lerning model that predicts the occurence of a heart attack failure using Classification algorithms in the Sckit-learn module in python.
the deployed model is the Python scipt file with the extension .py which is deployed over a webpage using streamlit module in the terminal window
steps to deploy this model:
 1.open command prompt
 2. type 'streamlit run model.py' which is the python script file
 3. A streamlit developed webpage with the contents of the algorithm will then run
 4. the user enters his/ her heart rate values, age, resting heart rate, sugar levels and many more values required for the model to determine the target 

::PS -> Please enjoy this model any questions send it to my email in my profile ğŸ‘ŒğŸ™Œ
